# Usage
```javascript
import FontAwesomePro, { Icons } from 'react-native-fontawesome-pro';

...
render() {
  return (
    <View>
      <FontAwesomePro 
        size={100}
        color='red'
        font='light'
        icon={Icons.barcodeAlt}
      />
    </View>
  );
},
```
# Note on hyphens
Javascript don't accept hyphens as valid object names hence all hyphens where removed and
names converted to camel case.

Example: `th-large` becomes `thLarge`

# Why this is fast, and uses almost no extra memory
This package uses the Text element to render Icons. The Text element delegates
to the OS the render process of the icons based on the Font file.
Both IOS and Android render fonts amazingly fast with little memory overhead. In essence
FontAwesome.ttf will be used by the OS to render icons and will benefit of years
of native software improvement as well hardware acceleration.
